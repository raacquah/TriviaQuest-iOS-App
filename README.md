## Built With Swift

This project is built using modern Apple technologies:

* **Language:** [**Swift**](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
* **UI Framework:** [**SwiftUI**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
* **IDE:** [**Xcode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

The trivia questions are currently hardcoded in a `TriviaQuestion` model array, making it easy to add or modify content directly in the source code.

* [ ] **Add a Countdown Timer:** Introduce a timer for each question to add a layer of challenge.
* [ ] **Question Categories:** Allow users to select specific categories of trivia they want to play.
* [ ] **Save High Scores:** Use `UserDefaults` or `Core Data` to persist the user's high score between sessions.
* [ ] **Add Animations & Sound Effects:** Enhance the user experience with engaging visual and audio feedback.
